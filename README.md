# Cengo
Cengo is a program that allows users to play any pc video game using their hand signs and symbols instead of using mouse and keyboard. It uses OpenCV python script to access the userâ€™s webcam, Mediapipe from Google to recognise hands, color detection for mouse movements and PyAutoGUI library of python to emulate keypresses. The combination of these allows users to play games using hand signs. 

Clone the respository into your pc on any folder. Run markerMouse and open any game to play it in.
